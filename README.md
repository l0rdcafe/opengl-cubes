# opengl-cubes
OpenGL C++ program using GLFW, GLM to render and transform interactive cubes in a 3D space

# Prerequisites

**For MacOS only**

You'll need to install `glm` and `glfw` before running this program. `brew install glfw3 glm` for the extra dependencies. You might need to edit the `Makefile` to update the path to the lib binaries that start with `/usr/local/Cellar/[libname]/[version_num]/lib`
